<h3>There are two modes of data transfer from server</h3>

<h5>All at once</h5>
<p>
If we do not have a large data set (less then 500 rows), we can push all the data to client and client can
manage the data locally (sorting, filtering etc). Pagination is optional and can be used for all the data.
If pagination is used the page requested is rendered from the available data.
</p>
<h5>Page by page.</h5>
<p>
We can fetch data page page basis. A http request is made for data used on each page. It is assumed that the
data service will have capability to deliver data in an incremental fashion. Sorting and filtering is for the
data service to carry out.
